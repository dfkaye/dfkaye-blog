<!--
This is my Home page.

At content/_index.md, using layouts/index.html.

You have found David Kaye's blog, focused almost entirely on front-end web development topics.

+ [more about me](/about/)
+ [blog posts](/posts/)
+ [demos](/demos/)

## Work in progress

What you see is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) blog under construction.

I have blogged previously with [wordpress](https://dfkaye.wordpress.com/) and on [github](http://dfkaye.github.io/) using [hexo](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo).

Some of that content will be posted here eventually, along with updated takes.

## My TODO list

+ pagination in /posts/

+ pagination in /demos/

+ rename "demos" to "suites" (maybe)

+ use hugo templating (--instead-of-css-vars) in the CSS
  - see https://zwbetz.com/use-hugo-templating-in-your-external-css/

+ better code snippet styles (not one element per line but well-framed and readable)

+ mermaid diagrams

+ set up RSS feed

+ sitemap.xml

+ categories and tags

+ add R&eacute;sum&eacute; page with @page and @print stylesheets

+ a **Tools I Use** page (see https://benjamincongdon.me/tools example)

+ move content from /about/ to /posts/

+ copy content from the wordpress site

+ list of engineering books I've read and/or recommend

+ list of engineering sites I might recommend

+ monthly list of dev-links - see https://github.com/dfkaye/dev-links/.

+ future awesome post about Function() (safe-eval) with strict CSP and web workers.

+ future awesome post about the SAM pattern
