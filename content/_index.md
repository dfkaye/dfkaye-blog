This is my Home page.

You have found David Kaye's blog, focused almost entirely on front-end web development topics.

I have been working on the web since 1997, initially as a tester, then as a front-end developer since 2000.

These days I am "dfkaye" on [twitter](https://twitter.com/dfkaye) and [github](http://github.com/dfkaye).

You can also find me as "david f kaye" on [linked-In](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidfkaye/).

## Work in progress

What you see is a Hugo blog under construction.

I have blogged previously with [wordpress](https://dfkaye.wordpress.com/) and on [github](http://dfkaye.github.io/) using [hexo](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo).

Some of that content will be posted here eventually, along with updated takes.
