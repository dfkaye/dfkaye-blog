<!--
This is my About page.

Using `layouts/_default/single.html`
-->

I have been working on the web since 1997, initially as a tester, then as a front-end developer/engineer since 2000.

## Getting in touch

These days I am "dfkaye" on [twitter](https://twitter.com/dfkaye) and [github](http://github.com/dfkaye).

You can also find me as <span aria-label="david f kaye">davidfkaye</span> on [linked-In](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidfkaye/).

You can also email me at dfkaye@yahoo.com.

## Code, Demos

I really like writing [gists](https://gist.github.com/dfkaye) when dwelling on smaller code experiments.

More recently I've started creating "pens" on [code pen](https://codepen.io/dfkaye/pens/).
