I have been working on the web since 1997, initially as a tester, then as a front-end developer/engineer since 2000. My roles have broadened considerably during that time, from individual contributor to project lead and mentoring other developers.

My web development philosophy centers on user safety, accessibility, and test-driven development. I prefer to keep things clean and documented for the next person.

## Getting in touch

In lieu of a full r&eacute;sum&eacute;, you can scan my profile on [linked_In](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidfkaye/).

Find me as "dfkaye" on [twitter](https://twitter.com/dfkaye) and [github](http://github.com/dfkaye).

You can also email me at dfkaye@yahoo.com.

## Code, Demos

You can get a flavor for how I think by perusing my [gists](https://gist.github.com/dfkaye) which tend to dwell on smaller code experiments.

You can also see some working demos I've started making at [code pen](https://codepen.io/dfkaye/pens/).

I intend to pull many of those in to this site, given world enough and time.
