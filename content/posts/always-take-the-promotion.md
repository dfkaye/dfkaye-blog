## TL;DR

Taking that promotion is your chance to make *lasting* improvements to anything.

## Your time is limited and so is your credibility

You may not feel ready to leave your current responsibilities or focus. You may believe a that promotion means more responsibilities, less time to do what you really want, more stress and headache.

That seems logical, and I once thought so, too.

Until I was promoted and discovered the truth: With every promotion you gain credibility and more freedom to set the agenda and improve things.

That won't always happen, but if you don't take the chance, then it will never happen.

So take it. Use that freedom. Things may not be perfect, there may be tension or politics, but they really do want you to use that freedom.

## Don't undersell yourself

You've probably heard that too many times, but it's true. If they offer you the promotion and you don't take it, your career stalls. You may be happy doing what you do now for a long time, but the time comes when&hellip;

## Your perspective will change

You've probably hit that moment when you had the next good idea that was vetoed for whatever reason, but you're convinced you're on to something. How do you convince them?

You'll be tempted to carve out time from either more pressing tasks or your time away from work. We know where that leads: burnout. And you're not the only one on the team who has that moment.

Taking the promotion means you can now let your teammates take the time they need to prove or falsify their ideas. You can even give them your great next idea to work out, if they are willing.

And that means you are improving things already because you are reducing Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt, allowing everyone else to grow along with you.

## You're already growing

You'll soon notice how some people struggle with tasks or issues that seem simple or straightforward but they can't find their way out of the paper bag. You may have noticed that already and been called on to help out.

Guess what! You're already performing at the next level. So take the promotion.

## You can reduce stress by just listening

Everyone should feel comfortable speaking their minds (in an appropriate manner, of course), trying new things (which may or may not work), following their interests (which will change with experience).

Anything that gets in the way of that is deferred decision-making, or *stress*. The more acute, the worse it gets, so anything that increases stress should be addressed immediately.

If you take that promotion, you can make that effort or delegate it to the team to address however they think best, because ultimately, *reducing stress **is** delivering*.

## My experiences (some details omitted)

That's how it worked for me when I was a director of volunteers in San Francisco's Tenderloin district (a position for which I had infinitesimal training, back in the 1990s). I asked the volunteers how they wanted to improve things, they came up with their own ideas, and we agreed to them. Things improved and they became even more engaged.

That's how it worked for me when I became lead of a small distributed team building a JavaScript application for our clients (2018-19). I relied on the other members to work on things they preferred to work on and I took the "how do I make things safer for them so they can do their work" stuff and ran it by them and if we agreed we did it. Things improved repeatedly and we delivered.

## Concluding Unscientific Summary

Ultimately, it is not your responsibilities that increase but your horizons. Your responsibilities don't grow, they change. As your perspective increases, so will your empathy. As your empathy increases, your team will trust you. And because you understand them better, you will trust them.

## Closing

Whatever your doubts or ambitions, once you gain that perspective, you can take action.

So take it. It is your best chance at improving anything.
