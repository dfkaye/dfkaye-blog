<p>
  This paragraph is a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag in a content file with the ".html" extension.
</p>

<p>
  Early on I found that creating demos with application code requires inserting raw HTML into the markdown content,
  <a href="https://anaulin.org/blog/hugo-raw-html-shortcode/">using this shortcode by Ana Ulin</a>.
</p>

<p>
  That approach allows you to include localization attributes in HTML tags, <i lang="fr-FR">en français</i>, for
  example.
</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;i lang="fr-FR">en français&lt;/i>
</code></pre>

<p>
  Alternatively, you can name the content file with the ".html" extension instead, and include the usual front matter at
  the top of the content file, like so:
</p>

<pre><code>

  This paragraph is a &lt;code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/code> tag in a content.html file.
&lt;/p>

...
</code></pre>

<p>
  <strong>However, </strong> by using the ".html" extension in Hugo, you lose the processing power of partials.
  That's why the code blocks above are not styled with Hugo's code-fences as they are on msot other pages here.
</p>

<p>
  Anyway, food for thought&hellip;
