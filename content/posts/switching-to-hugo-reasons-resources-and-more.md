[Previously](/posts/2019/11/11/first-post-why-hugo/), I wrote about my experience working with Gatsby and my ultimate decision to move to Hugo instead. What follows is a calmer version of the story, and a list of resources I have consulted while making the switch.

## Lists

I maintain a github repository which is nothing more than a list of [interesting links for web developers](https://github.com/dfkaye/dev-links). That one has been growing for over 5 years and I felt it was time to cut over to a an active list in a static site I could run a link checker on... *et cetera.*

## Demos

I also wanted to create a few working demos (CSS-only tabs, for example, or an aria-accessible modal with some JavaScript), and found that my *free* Wordpress instance (at https://dfkaye.wordpress.com) does not allow static JavaScript or inline JavaScript tags. A paid plan allows for that, but I wanted to see about alternatives.

## So what happened?

Due to the hype in 2019 and a recommendation from a colleague, I started migrating my blog to [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). After generating the basic blog from a starter project (and hooking up Netlify with github), I was dismayed to find that importing specific JavaScript files into posts works in GatsbyJS only when you enter the page URL directly in the browser &mdash; without loading the whole blog first. When you load the blog and navigate by hyperlinks controlled by ReactJS routing, the external JavaScript files and inline JavaScript elements fail to load *because React scrubs them* - see more about that at https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/833.

##  All of which tells us...

Gatsby is not a static site generator

Yes, Gatsby uses ReactJS on the server to create, not a static site, but a Single Page Application (SPA) using ReactJS *on the client.* Unless you are hosting a page that must handle multiple views of a single data source, SPAs have enormous accessibility and performance limitations, as witness Adam Silver's 2014 post, [The disadvantages of single page applications](https://adamsilver.io/articles/the-disadvantages-of-single-page-applications/).

## And so...

After further searching (and emailing [Chris Ferdinandi](https://twitter.com/cferdinandi) of the ["Go Make Things" blog](https://gomakethings.com/)), I decided on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator written in the [go](https://golang.org/) programming language. Hugo supports HTML, CSS, JavaScript, markdown, and several others without a client-side framework getting in the way.

## Big collection of resources

[Awesome Hugo](https://github.com/budparr/awesome-hugo) has a massive list of articles and resources for Hugo.

## Book recommendation

Brian Hogan (2020), [Build Websites with Hugo](https://bookshop.org/books/build-websites-with-hugo-fast-web-development-with-markdown/9781680507263) - via `bookshop.org`.

Highly recommend Brian's approach that introduces you to concepts as you need them rather than give you everything at once.

## Things I found helpful

I wanted to cover a lot of bases before beginning the whole migration. Here's a spread out list:

### Installing On Windows 10

+ Use chocolatey
  1. install chocolatey (run as admin)
    https://chocolatey.org/courses/installation/installing#cmd
  1. install hugo using chocolatey
    https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#chocolatey-windows
  1. verify hugo with `hugo help`
  1. create/navigate to a directory that will serve as your hugo site
    (ex. C:\projects\MyBlog) and execute `hugo` from there to generate 
+ YouTube video (2017), **Install the Hugo binary** &#8594; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB0HLHjgQ7E

### YouTube

Watch the whole Hugo Tutorial series on YouTube by [Mike Dane](https://twitter.com/mike_dane).
  + https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtIqKaDlqXo&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3

This series of 23 videos - about 5&ndash;10 minutes each - covers the basics of installing Hugo, explaining content, themes, templates, shortcodes, etc.

### Starter projects

+ **HTML Skeleton** - Josh W Comeau (2020), **Starter HTML for every web page** &#8594; https://joshwcomeau.com/snippets/html/html-skeleton
+ *minimal* - Chris Ferdinandi's (2019) **Hugo Starter Project** &#8594; https://github.com/cferdinandi/hugo-starter#getting-started
  + Chris's blog post about it &#8594; https://gomakethings.com/the-hugo-starter-kit/

  - **bonus** &#8594; rdwatters repo includes a linkchecker written in @golang &#8594; https://github.com/rdwatters/hugo-starter/blob/master/linkcheck.go

### Documentation

Hugo documentation steps are everywhere.

+ When in doubt, start with the Hugo site &#8594; https://gohugo.io/
+ gohugohq.com is an older (2017) site with quick tips &#8594; https://gohugohq.com/

### Probably the best single post that covers almost everything

+ Ben Robertson (2018), **Designing Layouts for Screen Readers** &#8594; https://benrobertson.io/accessibility/designing-layouts-for-screen-readers
  - not Hugo-specific, but an early concern to keep in mind.

### Themes

Themes are not strictly necessary, but they are *shareable*. You do one of the following:

+ Go without a theme, meaning you will add things to the root-level folders
+ [Choose a theme to install in the themes folder](https://themes.gohugo.io/)
+ [Create your own theme](https://gohugobrasil.netlify.app/themes/creating/)

### Raw HTML
