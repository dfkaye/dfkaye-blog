Back in the days before the internet, I was a literature student at San Francisco State University, interested in poetry and criticism, when I stumbled across this bit of obscurity that appealed to me immensely.

## What is it?

It is the last sentence in T.S. Eliot's essay, [Andrew Marvell](http://world.std.com/~raparker/exploring/books/andrew_marvell.html):

{{< rawhtml >}}
<q prose lang="fr-FR">
C'etait une belle âme, comme on ne fait plus à Londres.
</q>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

You can see it here: https://twitter.com/dfkaye.

## Where does it come from?

Scholars didn't recognize the quotation for decades, but couldn't rule out that it was a bogus quotation.

William Empson identified it in his <time>1975</time> article in the *T. S. Eliot Review*, "Eliot and Politics" (which I will quote from a posthumous collection of Empson's essays, [Argufying](https://www.alibris.com/Argufying-Essays-on-Literature-and-Culture-William-Empson/book/410147?qsort=p&matches=17), University of Iowa Press, 1987).

Empson notes,

{{< rawhtml >}}
<q prose>
It says that Marvell had a fine spirit, such as are no longer found in London. But surely, no Frenchman would think that they ever had been found in London (at least, not in this assured elegiac tone).
</q>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

At the time, Eliot was writing for the *Times Literary Supplement*

{{< rawhtml >}}
<q prose>
 &hellip;which was then wholly anonymous and chillingly learned. The article needed a closing chord, and the scholars would never admit that they had failed to spot a quotation; cleary they deserved to have their legs pulled.
</q>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

## Why did you post the quote on your twitter bio?

{{< rawhtml >}}
<q prose>
  The great Legouis was asked about it, and naturally felt unwilling to pronounce that no Frenchman had ever said it; but only a few French writers would be likely to, he could say, and he was pretty sure none of them had. <strong>Besides, it was in bad French</strong>&hellip; [my emphasis].
</q>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

I wondered myself for a long time what was precisely bad about the French in the quotation.

Empson states in footnote number 2 that Eliot had introduced a "grammatical solecism" when he borrowed it from the final stanza in Jules Laforgue's poem, 
{{< rawhtml >}}
<a href="https://www.poemes.co/complainte-du-pauvre-jeune-homme.html" lang="fr-FR">Complainte du pauvre jeune homme</a>:
{{< /rawhtml >}}

{{< rawhtml >}}
<q verse lang="fr-FR">
Ils virent qu’c'était un’belle âme,<br/>
Comme on n’en fait plus aujourd’hui!
</q>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

{{< rawhtml >}}
<p><i lang="fr-FR">La diff&eacute;rence?</i></p>

<p>
Laforgue writes "<i lang="fr-FR">on n’en fait</i>" (where <i lang="fr-FR">en</i> is the direct object of <i lang="fr-FR">fait</i>), whereas Eliot omits it ("<i lang="fr-FR">on <strong>ne</strong> fait</i>").
</p>

<p>A friend of mine clarified the distinction via twitter messages:</p>
 
<q prose>
`<i lang="fr-FR">comme on ne fait plus à Londres</i>` is kind of correct, but not common. because the question is what is it we don't do anymore in London? the answer is obvious, so it's understandable.
</q>

<q prose>
I would qualify it as "stylistic grammar", wanting to pinch the brain of the reader who is going to pay attention to the "what"
</q>

<p>There you have it.</p>

<h2><i lang="fr-FR"><strong>Voil&agrave;</strong></i></h2>
